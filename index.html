    <h2 class="center-text">Brexit and the Effect on the British Fishing Industry</h2>

This line chart is about how the UK vessel landings distributed in main ports within in the UK, recorded from January to October 2016.        </h4>
        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
Although the result of Brexit is not easy to evaluate in such a short time period. We can still see that for landing in Scotland and England, there is an obvious growing happened after the national declaration of referendum result. Some EU regulation such as fishier policy and fishing quota has made the UK local industry being taken advantages by other EU countries for decades.


        </p>
        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
Speaking of common fisheries policy, it affect all European fishing fleets but have been proved that the restriction particularly severe in recent years for the demersal or whitefish sector of the Scottish fishing industry. Leave out the seasonal factor, an absolute increase of landings in UK especially in the port of Scotland can be observed. So withdrawing from EU will enable Britain to regain control of its waters. We expect this growing consistently in the future.

What we interested next is that whether the renaissance of fish industry can have a positive impact to the employment. (potential topic)

            Overview of Landings into the UK by UK Vessels vs Foreign Vessels and Landings Abroad by UK Vessels
        </h4>
        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            When looking at the data of UK landings by UK vessels, UK landings by foreign vessels and foreign landings by
            UK vessels, we can see that right after the EU referendum there was a sudden spike in landings in all three categories
            followed by a steep descent in August and September. This decline in landings happens a little bit earlier compared
            to the previous two years, when the October seems to be the peak month of the year. The decline in UK landings by
            foreign vessels is especially significant as it hits its lowest value in nearly two years. It will be interesting
            to see if the negative trend will continue for the next months or if the landings will pick up like they have
            done in the early months of the previous two years. Will foreign vessels continue to land fish in UK ports or
            will they withdraw in numbers as a result of the UKâ€™s decision to leave the EU?
        </p>
        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            Also of interest is the distribution of the three categories. The landings (quantity in tonnes) in the UK by UK
            vessels is by far greater than the UK landings by foreign vessels. This indicates that the UK does actually have a lot
            of control of their waters in terms of landings. Even more, landings abroad by UK landings is significantly
            higher than UK landings by foreign vessels. It will be interesting to see whether other countries such as France
            and Denmark will impose restrictions on how much UK vessels can fish and sell in their ports as a result of the
            referendum.

	    		Considering all industries, the UK imports more than it exports and, as s result, it maintains a negative balance of payments a.k.a. a trade deficit. In the context of both a cheaper pound sterling and the re-introduction of duty charges in European trade, exporting could still become more profitable but would this outweigh the costs of more expensive importing? Is the trade deficit getting any smaller?
